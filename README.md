# Git is Neat
A talk on some cool extra features in `git`.

## Format
1. 20-30 minute presentation
1. 30 minutes of interactive discovery, questions.

### Interactive part
There are scripts in this repo to get you into interesting `git` states. All you
have to do is reset the repo between examples.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benortiz/talk-git-is-neat.git
cd talk-git-is-neat/
# Run an example
# Have fun and break things
git reset --hard origin master
# Run another example
```

## New to git
A couple of great resources to wrap your head around `git`:

* Presentation: [Git for Ages 4 and Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4)
  * Great at visually describing how to think of branches, commits, and history.
* Reading: [Think Like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/)
  * Without throwing a wall of text at you, this site breaks down git. I wish I
    had something like this around when I was first picking up git.

## I've badly broken things and I need help
* [GitFixUm](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html)
  * A choose-your-own-adventure style guide to fixing things.
* [First Aid git](http://firstaidgit.io/#/)
  * An FAQ of git situations.
* [How to undo (almost) anything with Git](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/)
  * A blog post with some descriptions to help you understand what's going on.
* [Flight Rules for Git](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)
  * A maintained repo with lots of ways to fix things.

## I want to goof off during the interactive part
